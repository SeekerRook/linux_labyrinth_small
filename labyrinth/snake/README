In this room there is a password protected zip file.

You know the owner is a student in NTUA and the password is their age in this format d-m-y (exc 1-1-1821)

to crack the password you can use a tool John the Ripper. It works like this:

zip2john <name>.zip > hash

john hash --wordlist=<wordlist_file>


where <name> is the name of the zip file and <word_list> the file containing possible passwords.

Only problem is we dont have a wordlist.

Can you make a python script to generate one and find the password?

after you are done you can unzip the file using unzip <name>.zip
